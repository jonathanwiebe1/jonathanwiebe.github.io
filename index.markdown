I am a health solutions and standards architect with a strong focus on advancing electronic healthcare, particularly in the areas of interoperability and standards. With a background in development, I have spent many years designing health systems that align with V3 and, more recently, FHIR standards. My passion lies in improving interoperability and continuity of care within the health sector.

For more details about my professional journey, please refer to my story on the [About](/about/) page or view my [resume](resume.html). I currently serve as the director (and only employee) of a consulting corporation based in British Columbia, Canada.


Why hire me?  I am a friendly cooperative co-worker with deep experiences in architecture, software development, healthcare and engineering.  I have been  in leadership roles organizing and guiding teams to be successful and efficient.  And as a mentor, helping less experienced team members achieve their personal and company goals.
