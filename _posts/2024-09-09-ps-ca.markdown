Through [Dogwood Health Consulting](https://dogwoodhealthconsulting.com/) I've been contracted to [Infoway Canada](https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/) to help them develop the [Canadian Patient Summary](https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/digital-health-initiatives/interoperability/patient-summary#canada) through balloting and publication.  This is a great opportunity, especially coming off working primarily for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the US, to help with Canadian Healthcare once again.
